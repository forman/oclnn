*oclnn* is a Backpropagation neural network (NN) implementation in Java that can run on any OpenCL enabled device.
I started the NN code base by looking at *backprop1* available at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/backprop1].

The *oclnn*  is available at [xxx].

To build it you will need Maven 3. Just cd into the main directory and type {mvn package}.
